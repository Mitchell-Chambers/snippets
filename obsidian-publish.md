## PostHog
1. Create a file in the root directory of the Obsidian Publish'ed vault called `publish.js` (make in a program outside of Obsidian otherwise it will chuck a `.md` on the end)
2. Get the code snippet required to make PostHog work, I've attached their [docs](https://posthog.com/docs/getting-started/install) below, you can get the prefilled snippet [here](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#snippet)

3. Dump that shit right into the `publish.js` file, make sure to remove the `<script>` `</script>` tags, it's already implied by the whole `.js` file thing.
4. Upload to site and check if it works.
